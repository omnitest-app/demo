# Omnitest Demonstrations
Guides to using Omnitest in various software development workflows.


**Flagship use case**: 
`omnitest . --runner=jest --pull-request`




## Omnitest CI
The CLI for filtering tests based on changes in the code.

### How-to

#### Overview
1. Get Omnitest CI binary and a license
2. Make it executable on your platform in your preferred way
3. Make a change in your code
4. Run Omnitest and give a path to your repository
5. Grab the list of tests Omnitest reported
6. Execute the list of tests

#### Specific: NodeJS variations
1. Install a NodeJS dependency `npm -g install madge` ([https://github.com/pahen/madge#installation](link))
2. Change a line of code
3. Execute `omnitest path/to/repo`
4. Execute tests, e.g. `npm test <list of tests from Omnitest>` o

**Demo: ExpressJS + Jest**
```
# Clone a starter (e.g. https://github.com/w3cj/express-api-starter-ts)
npx create-express-api --typescript --directory demo
cd demo

npm install
npm -g install madge

# Change something
echo "// a demonstration" > src/interfaces/MessageResponse.ts

# Analyse and run tests
omnitest . --runner=jest
```

#### Specific: GitHub pull request workflow
TODO
```
- name: Run tests with Omnitest filtering
  run: |
    export OMNITEST_CI_KEY=${{Â vars.OMNITEST_LICENSE }}
    omnitest --runner=jest --pull-request
```


#### Get Omnitest CI binary and license
TODO
- where and how
- platforms
- subscription & billing

#### Executing
TODO
- where and how
- license usage
- platforms
- built-ins & manual data creation

#### Change management

##### Providing changes manually
It is possible to provide changes manually via a `changes.json` located at the root of the provided project directory. If the file exists, it will be the sole source of changes, unless the `--pull-request` was provided, in which case the file will be skipped.

Changes.json format
```
[
  { "target": "path/to/changed/file" }
]
```

These changes will be used just like auto-discovered changes.
```
./your-script-to-create-changes > changes.json
omnitest . --runner=jest
```

You can also further process the effects of the changes manually.
```
./your-script-to-create-changes > changes.json
declare -a affected_tests=$(omnitest . --names-only)

# Read the changes in your script line by line,
echo ${affected_tests} | ./your-script-to-run-affected-tests

# or do some data formatting.
#   E.g. Replace \n's and provide the test files as arguments.
```

##### Changes from pull requests in GitHub
When `--pull-request` is provided, Omnitest will automatically compare the target and source branches for differences. For this, the `GITHUB_BASE_REF` and `GITHUB_SOURCE_REF` need to be provided. They define the target and source branches as defined in [GitHub Variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables).

Clever usage of the workflow outside of the GitHub may be possible.
